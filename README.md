# Lua Hangman

This is a simple demo, and may be useful to those learning the Lua language. All source code is in a single file that doesn't bear too much complexity. Implements Lua coroutines to gather and validate user input. For more information on the Lua language, visit the [Lua Website](https://www.lua.org/). If you want to learn more about using the Lua programming language, I recommend the official [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil) book.
